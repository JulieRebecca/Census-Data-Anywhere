# This app was developed by Sarah Hugenberger and Adrianna ______ at the Austin
# hackathon. It sets up the Shiny web interface to gather information used by
# Scott Macdonell's R script AddCensusDemographics.R

# The Shiny app/script can be used to add demographic data to any shapefile.
# The necessary input are the following:
# --Shapefiles (zipfile with all necessary shapefile parts)
# --Census API key (necessary for accessing census data, they limite queries)
# --State where shapefile is located
# 

# Check if other libraries are needed
